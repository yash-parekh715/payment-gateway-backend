  amount: {

    required: true,
  },
  currency: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  payment_method: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    default: "automatic",
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["pending", "completed", "failed", "refunded"],
    default: "pending",
  },
  stripe_payment_id: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
}, { timestamps: true });
API Design
The API design for the payment gateway backend is as follows:

Endpoints
Create Payment
Method: POST
Endpoint: /payments
Request Body: user_id, amount, currency, payment_method
Response: payment_id
Process Payment
Method: PATCH
Endpoint: /payments/:payment_id
Request Body: status
Response: payment_status
Retrieve Payment Status
Method: GET
Endpoint: /payments/:payment_id
Response: payment_status
Handle Refund
Method: POST
Endpoint: /refunds
Request Body: payment_id, amount
Response: refund_id
API Security
The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. Each request must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

Data Flow and Interaction between Components
The data flow and interaction between components is as follows:

The client sends a request to create a payment to the payment routes.
The payment routes validate the request and call the payment controller to create a new payment.
The payment controller creates a new payment using the payment model and saves it to the MongoDB database.
The payment controller returns the payment ID to the payment routes.
The payment routes return the payment ID to the client.
The client sends a request to process the payment to the payment routes.
The payment routes validate the request and call the payment controller to update the payment status.
The payment controller updates the payment status using the payment model and saves it to the MongoDB database.
The payment controller returns the payment status to the payment routes.
The payment routes return the payment status to the client.
The client sends a request to retrieve the payment status to the payment routes.
The payment routes validate the request and call the payment controller to retrieve the payment status.
The payment controller retrieves the payment status using the payment model and returns it to the payment routes.
The payment routes return the payment status to the client.
The client sends a request to handle a refund to the payment routes.
The payment routes validate the request and call the payment controller to create a new refund.
The payment controller creates a new refund using the payment model and saves it to the MongoDB database.
The payment controller returns the refund ID to the payment routes.
The payment routes return the refund ID to the client.
Security Measures
The payment gateway backend uses the following security measures:

Data Encryption: The MongoDB database uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.
Authentication: The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
Authorization: The API uses role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize requests.
Input Validation: The API validates all input data to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
